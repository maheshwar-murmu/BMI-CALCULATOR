# BMI Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python project to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input. The program takes weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters), performs the BMI calculation, and displays the result in a user-friendly format.

## Features
- Simple console-based interface.
- Input for weight (kg) and height (cm).
- Accurate BMI calculation using the formula:  
  **BMI = weight (kg) / ((height (cm) / 100)Â²)**.
- Result rounded to two decimal places for better readability.
- Categorization of BMI results:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
  - Normal weight: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 25
  - Overweight: BMI â‰¥ 25

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Concepts Used
- Handling user input with `input()`.
- Using variables and data types like `float`.
- Performing mathematical operations (division and exponentiation).
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for logical operations.
- String formatting (`f-strings`) for clean output.

## How to Run:
1. Copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., `bmi_calculator.py`).
2. Run the file in any Python environment (IDE, terminal, or command prompt).
3. Input your weight and height when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display your BMI along with its category.

This project is perfect for Python beginners looking to practice basic input handling, mathematical computations, and formatted outputs. ðŸš€
